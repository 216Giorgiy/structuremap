<!--Title: StructureMap-->
<ProjectSummary />


StructureMap is the oldest, continuously used IoC/DI container for .Net with an original release and inclusion in a production application all the way back in June 2004 on .Net 1.1.  
The current 3.1 release represents 10 years of lessons learned in the StructureMap and greater .Net community -- while also wiping away a <b>great</b> deal of legacy design
decisions that no longer make sense today.
