<!--Title: StructureMap-->
<ProjectSummary />

StructureMap is the oldest, continuously used IoC/DI container for .Net with an original release and usage in a production application all the way back in June 2004 on .Net 1.1.  
The current 3.0 release represents 10 years of lessons learned in the StructureMap and greater .Net community -- while also wiping away a **lot** of legacy design
decisions that no longer make sense today.
