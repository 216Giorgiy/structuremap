Once in a while you might want to get an enumerable of all the configured objects for a PluginType.  That's done with the `GetAllInstances()` method shown below:

<Snippet name="get-all-instances" />

<Info><code>GetAllInstances()</code> respects the order in which the actual instances are configured in the Container.  Be warned that some other IoC tools make different assuptions if you are coming from a different tool.</Info>
