<!--Title: Resolving Services-->

<markdown>

The `IContainer` interface acts as a [Service Locator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern) to build and resolve configured services on demand.
While in most systems you would probably only resolve the default service of a type or a named instance of a service, there are far more ways to resolve services
exposed by StructureMap.
