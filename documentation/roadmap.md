StructureMap 3.0 released in early 2014 marked a huge change in the StructureMap internals and public API's. 

The ongoing work for version 4.0 is a much smaller release that primarily improves type scanning,
diagnostics, and performance. The only breaking changes from 3 to 4 are in custom type scanning conventions.

Please log any suspected bugs or feature requests on [StructureMap's GitHub page](https://github.com/structuremap/structuremap).

After 4.0 is released, the StructureMap team will finally focus on the new DNX platform and officially support a [StructureMap adapter for DNX](https://github.com/structuremap/structuremap.dnx). 

## Ongoing and upcoming work

1. The 4.0 work can be browsed from the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/structuremap/structuremap/milestones/4.0).
1. A new package called _StructureMap.DynamicInterception_ for adding support for AOP with Castle.Core dynamic proxies to StructureMap
1. The StructureMap.DNX package for DNX integration (an early version is already available on Nuget.org)
1. Sometime in 2016 StructureMap **will** support the CoreCLR
