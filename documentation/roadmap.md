StructureMap 3.0 marked a huge change in the StructureMap internals and public API's. 4.0 is a much smaller release that primarily improves type scanning,
diagnostics, and performance. The only breaking changes from 3 to 4 are in custom type scanning conventions.

Please log any suspected bugs or feature requests on [StructureMap's GitHub page](https://github.com/structuremap/structuremap).

After 4.0 is released, the StructureMap team will finally focus on the new DNX platform and officially support a StructureMap adapter for DNX.
